It was very difficult to push or clone something from GitHub when I logged into the ZJE server. So I downloaded git bash and then the process became very quick. And I also found that the repository default branch is “main” instead of “master”. So we should type “git push origin main” instead of “git push origin master” when we want to push our files into our own repository on GitHub if we don't change the repository default branch before. This told us we should check our branch name before executing some commands. Cooperating with our classmates and searching for problems on the Internet by ourselves is also important.
