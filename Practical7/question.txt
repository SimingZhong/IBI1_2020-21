Question: 
South Korea, Kenya, and Colombia are three countries in different parts of the world, but with similar populations. 
Plot the total number of COVID cases over time in all three.

Line number: 58

Discussion:
We can know from the plot that the numbers of total cases are different among these three countries. 
However, we already know that these countries have similar populations.
So the differences in numbers of total cases might be caused by their different locations in the world.
South Korea is the closest country to China among these three countries, which means, it may have more contact with China.
And that may explain why South Korea has more cases than Kenya and Colombia.
