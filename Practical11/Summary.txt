Findings:

Alignment scores:
human-mouse: 1091
human-random: -250
mouse-random: -250

The percentage of identical amino acids:
human-mouse: 89.64%
human-random: 5.41%
mouse-random: 5.86%



Interpretation:

Humans and mice have a high percentage of identical amino acids, which shows the biological homology. 
Comparing the percentage of identical amino acids of human-mouse pair and human-random pair, 
we can know that, in different species, the function of the same protein may be similar.
That's why we can test new drugs for human in mice.
However, there are still about 10% of amino acids that are different.
That special protein sequence may be the characteristic sequence for the species, 
and it may help us to identify proteins from different species.
Maybe this is one of the important reasons why some drugs are effective in mice, 
however, are less effective in the human body.
